NetWorld
========

This is an online role-playing game, runnign with a java server
and an applet for the client-side UI.  

This is my first project in java, written in 2001. 

The game is sprite-based and has a drag-and-drop inventory, a 
way to talk to other players and mobs.  It also has a decent AI
system for programmable creatures.  It handles spells and effects
on objects, and has a lot of variety in damage and defense, which 
makes it a little more interesting to both attack and defend oneself
(slash, bludgeon, pierce, fire, ice, magic). 

In /documentation there is help on using the UI, and config for AI 
and spells.  

TODO : 
 A map editor would make creating the world a lot easier.
